# DevConnector 2.0

> Social network for developers

This is a MERN stack application from the "MERN Stack Front To Back" course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/?couponCode=TRAVERSYMEDIA). It is a small social network app that includes authentication, profiles and forum posts.

## Updates since course published

Since the course was published, GitHub has [depreciated authentication via URL query parameters](https://developer.github.com/changes/2019-11-05-deprecated-passwords-and-authorizations-api/#authenticating-using-query-parameters)
You can get an access token by following [these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
For this app we don't need to add any permissions so don't select any in the _scopes_.
**DO NOT SHARE ANY TOKENS THAT HAVE PERMISSIONS**
This would leave your account or repositories vulnerable, depending on permissions set.

It would also be worth adding your `default.json` config file to `.gitignore`
If git has been previously tracking your `default.json` file then...

```bash
git rm --cached config/default.json
```

Then add your token to the config file and confirm that the file is untracked with `git status` before pushing to GitHub.
You'll also need to change the options object in `routes/api/profile.js` where we make the request to the GitHub API to...

```js
const options = {
  uri: encodeURI(
    `https://api.github.com/users/${req.params.username}/repos?per_page=5&sort=created:asc`
  ),
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'user-agent': 'node.js',
    Authorization: `token ${config.get('githubToken')}`
  }
};
```

## Quick Start

### Add a default.json file in config folder with the folowing

```
{
  "mongoURI": "<your_mongoDB_Atlas_uri_with_credentials>",
  "jwtSecret": "secret",
  "githubToken": ""
}
```
